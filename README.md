# TIC-TAC-TOE-GAME
I have created the classic childhood game Tic-Tac-Toe, a simple and interactive game involving two players.  
Using the Java programming language, I designed a grid representing the 9 spaces where players can place their marks. A player wins by aligning 3 marks in a row or column, and if all 9 squares are filled without a winner, the game ends.
